# K-means

this project is based on [paper](https://github.com/luzhixing12345/Rough-K-means/releases/download/v0.0.1/K-means.and.ant.colony.algorithm.pdf) which is about an research for improving K-means algorithm by ant colony algorithm

this project including two parts

- [a rough K-means algorithm]
- an improved rough K-means clustering algorithm combining ant colony algorithm

this project is **not** an offical implementation, **just for fun**

## Use
